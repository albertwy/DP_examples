some simple examples of Dynamic Programming used for RL

This project is created based on code writed by QiangYe whose blogs' location is https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/reinforce. His online demo's location is https://qqiang00.github.io/reinforce/javascript/demo_iteration.html.

QiangYe's code is a complete example for policy evaluation, I just change some functions or add some functions into it. 



This project includes:
policy_evaluation.py   it's a example about policy evaluation.
policy_iteration.py  it's a example about policy iteration which is created by adding some codes to policy_evaluation.py .
value_iteration.py  it's a example about value iteration .
iteration.py it's a example about value iteration. but I replace state-value function in value_iteration.py with action-value function.
